# Overview
## The private bookmarking tool. Save quotes and the pages they come from across the web to Google Sheets - no new account needed.

Save interesting bits across the web with their source, an image if available and tags. I wanted a way to easily save things as I browsed the web so I made this. I'm so tired of creating accounts for things and giving everyone my data so I made it on Google Sheets. No account or data sharing. Everything is private and yours to control.
